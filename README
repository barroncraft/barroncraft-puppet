Puppet scripts and configuration used to setup the servers for Barron Minecraft.  To create your own server, run the folowing as the root user (assuming debian or similar):

apt-get install puppet git-core
rm -rf /etc/puppet/*
git clone git://github.com/Nullreff/minecraft-puppet.git /etc/puppet
puppet apply /etc/puppet/manifests/setup.pp

This is still a work in progress, so don't use it on your production servers...
