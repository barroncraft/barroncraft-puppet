Puppet scripts and configuration used to setup the servers for Barron Minecraft.  To create your own server, run the folowing as the root user (assuming debian or similar):

wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/barroncraft/barroncraft-puppet/master/install/base.sh | sh

This is still a work in progress, so don't use it on your production servers...
