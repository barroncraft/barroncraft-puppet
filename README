Puppet scripts and configuration used to setup the servers for Barron Minecraft.  These scripts have only been tested to work on Debian Stable and are still a work in progress.  Please don't use them unless you're ok with things breaking.

To create your own server, run one of the folowing as the root user:

Base:
wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/barroncraft/barroncraft-puppet/master/bin/install-base.sh | sh

Minecraft Dota:
wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/barroncraft/barroncraft-puppet/master/bin/install-dota.sh | sh
